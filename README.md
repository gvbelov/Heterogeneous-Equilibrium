Calculation of complex chemical equilibria
An approach to the calculation of complex chemical equilibrium using the optimization package Ipopt and the package JuMP is proposed. The code of two functions written in the Julia programming language are presented for calculating the equilibrium composition and properties of multicomponent heterogeneous thermodynamic systems and several examples are presented.
